                        This was a project I did for my Data Structures class. The game logic generates random 2D worlds for the 
                        player to explore. It was written in Java, and I really am happy with how it turned out.

                        This is a project I'm working on for Goodly Labs. Public Editor is a tool that provides credibility ratings
                        for news articles. It also trains people to provide these ratings themselves. Our mission is to combat misinformation and fake news.
