        Character Profile
        <h3>
        <p>
            Cox is sarcastic, cynical, and has a quick, cruel wit, normally expressed through frequent and sometimes incredibly long rants. 
            These rants were often handed to McGinley the night before, or on the day of recording. At the beginning of the series, he is the chief 
            attending physician at Sacred Heart Hospital; he is later promoted to residency director and, by the eighth season, to chief of medicine. 
            In the ninth and final season, he becomes a professor when Sacred Heart is turned into a medical school. He is the superior and unwilling 
            mentor of the series' protagonist, John "J.D." Dorian (Zach Braff). He has a "married but not married" relationship with his equally acerbic ex-wife, 
            Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller), with whom he has a son, Jack, and a daughter, Jennifer Dylan. He treats virtually everyone in the hospital with derision,
            especially his longtime nemesis, Chief of Medicine Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Cox is athletic, often found playing basketball in the hospital's parking lot with younger employees. In "My Friend the Doctor", 
            he shows off by slam-dunking a basketball, but injures his back when he lands, a reminder that he is middle-aged. Out of vanity, 
            he tries to hide his injury. He is also extremely narcissistic and egocentric; when named by a magazine as the best doctor in the city, 
            he lines up every staff member beneath him, and his ex-wife, to consecutively praise him, or risk a physical reprisal from the Janitor (Neil Flynn).

        Relationships
        <h3>
        <p>
            Cox constantly berates the residents, giving John "J.D." Dorian female nicknames (e.g. "Tiffany", "Jennifer", "Carol", "Betsy", "Lindsey") 
            and regularly calling him "Newbie". He also calls Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke) "Barbie", Turk (Donald Faison) "Gandhi" and Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins) 
            "Bob-O", "Bobcat", "Bobmeister", "Big Bob", and "Beelzebob". The one person he openly admits to tolerating is head nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes). 
            Throughout Season 1, he and Turk compete for her affections, with Cox eventually bowing out when he sees that Turk and Carla are in love. 
            In one episode, it is seen that Cox helped Turk with how to deal with women when they are mad, Turk eventually taking Perry's advice. 
            Turk soon learns that Carla and Cox went on a date before Turk came to the hospital.[13]
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite his contempt for Turk in early seasons, Cox develops a restrained level of respect for him, and even occasionally gets along with and 
            relates to him. In the Season 6 episode, "My Road To Nowhere", when complications are found with his unborn child he insists that Turk assist 
            with the surgery. Being reluctant at first, he even appoints Turk as the Chief Surgeon of Sacred Heart. Cox makes this decision after being 
            told by Kelso that his own promotions by Kelso were against the latter's personal disdain for Cox, yet Cox's excellent medical knowledge made 
            him the best candidate nonetheless - a feature that Turk shares with Cox.
            He berates Elliot almost as much as J.D., frequently making fun of her insecurity, hairstyle and WASP background. However, he has also been known to stand 
            up for her: he punches Kelso in the face when he yells at her in front of the staff.[3]
        </p>
        <p>
            Cox despises Kelso, Sacred Heart's chief of medicine. They disagree constantly about the best way to provide care, with Cox advocating for patients 
            and Kelso adhering to the hospital's bottom line. At one point, he even punches Kelso in the face.[3] On occasion, however, they have acknowledged 
            the necessity of the other's position, and Kelso has admitted that they need each other.[12] When Kelso retires and Cox succeeds him as chief of medicine, 
            Cox confides in him about the pressures of the job, and the two form a "secret friendship".[14]
        </p>
        <p>
            He berates J.D. from their first meeting[17] and emphatically denies being his mentor, despite J.D.'s repeated attempts to win his favor. Nonetheless, 
            Cox has shown concern for J.D.'s welfare, such as telling him not to blame himself for a patient's death[11] and (reluctantly) comforting him when his 
            father dies.[18] He also tells J.D. that he trusts him as a doctor and a person and has taken an interest in him from the start because he seems 
            "to actually give a crap".[19] Cox also recommends him as a promising, skilled, and hard-working doctor to a review board.[20] In "My Finale", 
            Cox finally admits that he considers J.D. a talented doctor, a good person, and a friend, although he has to be tricked into it. He refuses to 
            say this directly to J.D. or to hug him. A flash-forward scene at the end of the episode suggests that Cox will be a part of J.D.'s life well into 
            the future (reluctantly, of course).[21]
