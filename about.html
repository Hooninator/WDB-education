                        I was an econ major for a while, and then I took CS61A and fell in love with programming. From then on, I've been a CS major, and I 
                        was able to officially declare this semester. This semester, I'm in CS61C, and CS169.

                    Policy Debate
                    <p id="description-txt">
                        I did policy debate in high school, and I was on the UC Berkeley Policy Debate team for two years. While on the Berkeley team, I found significant success at the national level,
                        and placed well/won several major tournaments. As a result of my time with policy debate, I can talk at over 400 words per minute!

                        To be honest I actually have zero hobbies, school takes up most of my time... But I do enjoy running, cooking, and video games whenever I do have free time.

                        I grew up in Cottage Grove, Oregon, a tiny town of about 9,000 people that you've never heard of. I went to school in Eugene, and Berkeley has been my dream
                        school since forever, so being here is amazing!

                        I'm interested in web development primarily. More specifically, I'm interested in finding ways to speed up some of the slower parts of web applications,
                        to hopefully great effect!

                    <p id="description-txt">
                        1. I can fit an entire orange in my mouth, and in fact I'm 0.1 inches away from the world record for the largest mouth gape<br>
                        2. I can pogo stick with no hands for over an hour<br>
                        3. My family recently found out that we're primarily Jewish instead of Italian... and none of us have any idea where the Jewish blood came from. Scandalous!
